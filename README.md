**MapLite** is the ultimate solution for secure, real‚Äëtime group location sharing, chat, and AI-powered feedback. Built with privacy at its core, MapLite enables many-to-many location sharing and messaging in dynamic rooms‚Äîwithout persisting sensitive data on the cloud. All operations are handled in-memory, leveraging stateless JWT authentication for lightning-fast, secure microservice communication.
